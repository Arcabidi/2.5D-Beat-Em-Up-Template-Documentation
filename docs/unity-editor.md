## Hierarchy window

<figure markdown="span">
    ![hierarchy_window_1.png](assets/images/hierarchy_window_1.png)
</figure>

The [Hierarchy window](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Hierarchy.html) is located in the top left corner of the Unity Editor by default. For this template GameObjects in the hierarchy have been divided based on the [system](scripting/systems/index.md) they belong to and sorted by their transforms rather than alphanumerically. For example, in the Training scene above the UIManager is placed under the UI system while the AudioManager is placed under the Audio system.

!!! Info

    Unity uses this same format for the hierarchy window in its own [sample projects](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/tutorial-projects/dragon-crashers-urp-2d-sample-project-190721?srsltid=AfmBOoqwWEulvRLm8O6SG66BZFlzVuN-H4BR2vGijbf-9IsTwyJstfzF). <figure markdown="span">
