# Unity Editor

!!! Summary

    This page describes how the Unity environment is organized for the template. It can help you navigate through the projectâ€™s files or bring up details you may want to consider when organizing your own game.

## Automatic setup

This package includes automatic setup features to ensure a smooth experience when importing into a Unity project. These scripts are located at `BeatEmUpTemplate/Assets/Scripting/Editor`.

Once the import is detected `AutoSetupManager.cs` runs all setup tasks in sequence:

1. Configures the Input System (`InputSystemSetup.cs`)
2. Sets up URP assets (`URPAutoSetup.cs`)
3. Opens the Initialization scene (`InitializationSceneOpener.cs`)
4. Shows the Welcome screen (`WelcomeScreen.cs`)

You can also manually run the setup by selecting `Window > Arcabidi > 2.5D Beat 'Em Up Template > Run Auto Setup`. See `AutoSetupGuide.txt` for more information.

## Hierarchy window

<figure markdown="span">
    ![hierarchy_window_1.png](assets/images/hierarchy_window_1.png)
</figure>

The [Hierarchy window](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Hierarchy.html) is located in the top left corner of the Unity Editor by default. For this template GameObjects in the hierarchy have been divided based on the [system](systems/index.md) they belong to and sorted by their transforms rather than alphanumerically. For example, in the Training scene above the UIManager is placed under the UI system while the AudioManager is placed under the Audio system.

!!! Info

    Unity uses this same format for the hierarchy window in its own [sample projects](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/tutorial-projects/dragon-crashers-urp-2d-sample-project-190721?srsltid=AfmBOoqwWEulvRLm8O6SG66BZFlzVuN-H4BR2vGijbf-9IsTwyJstfzF). <figure markdown="span">
